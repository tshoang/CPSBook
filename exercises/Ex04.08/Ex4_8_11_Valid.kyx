  [{x'=1 & false}] false
End.

/*
 * This example is quite counter-intuitive. The "false" evolution domain ensure 
 * that for any future time t that the duration 0..t satisfies the "false"
 * evaluation domain, the post condition "false" is hold. Essentially, "false"
 * evaluation domain acts as a false assumption.
 * The proof use ODE (with "invariant" false).
